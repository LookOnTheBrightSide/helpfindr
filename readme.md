### Helper Finder

This is only the views for helper finder. I am yet to decide on the technologies that will be used for the backend.
You will need sass on your machine.
Try and keep the stylesheets modular.
Comment out code.
Don't leave commented out code in the code base.
No libraries for responsiveness for now.
Use media queries if you need to implement a responsive view.
Keep in mind that this is going to be a dynamic site when styling.
Try and develop the site running on a local server.
I am using http-server module - https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server


Future
